This study addresses the issues of traditional methods for multimodal image fusion, which rely on manually designed rules, prioritize feature expression capabilities, and have low interpretability of fusion results. It proposes a model-driven multimodal image fusion neural network architecture. By combining the advantages of model-driven and data-driven approaches, this study significantly improves the detail retention ability and scene adaptability of the fused images while retaining physical meaning.
